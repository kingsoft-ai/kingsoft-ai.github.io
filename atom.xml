Prepare the Articles and Assets"></a>Step 1. Prepare the Articles and Assets</h3><p>For easy editing and aesthetic presentation, we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">markdown</a> syntax to edit the content of the article. </p><ul><li>Prepare the article file with <strong>.md</strong> suffix (example: article.md).</li><li>Create a resource folder If the article contains image or other assets (example: article).</li><li>Make sure that the article file is the same name as the resource folder and is in the same level directory.</li><li>Compress all files into a zip file.<blockquote><p>The contents in zip file may be as below:<br>article.zip<br>|——article.md<br>|——article</p></blockquote></li></ul><h3 id="Step-2-Upload-for-Publishing"><a href="#Step-2-Upload-for-Publishing" class="headerlink" title="Step 2.

We combine publishing and uploading into a single function that makes you feel so easy to publish your own article.</p><ul><li>Open the <a href="http://192.168.145.36:8080/job/Article-Publisher/build?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publishing website</a>.</li><li>Select <strong>Publish</strong> in command option bar.</li><li>Click the <strong>Browse</strong> button and select your zip file and click <strong>Open</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Build</strong> button to start publishing.</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Remove-the-Articles-Published-Before"><a href="#How-to-Remove-the-Articles-Published-Before" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove the Articles Published Before"></a>How to Remove the Articles Published Before</h2><p>A few steps to remove the article published before as follows:</p><ul><li>Open the <a href="http://192.168.145.36:8080/job/Article-Publisher/build?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publishing website</a>.</li><li>Select <strong>Remove</strong> in command option bar.</li><li>Fill out the <strong>name of article file to be deleted</strong> in the <strong>Article File Name</strong> text box</li><li>Click <strong>Build</strong> button to delete.</li></ul><h2 id="Header-of-Article"><a href="#Header-of-Article" class="headerlink" title="Header of Article"></a>Header of Article</h2><p>As a standard norm and easy to read, we always expect author to define a very detailed header of the file. This is not only for the convenience of reading, but also for the better presentation.</p><p>You could use a pair of three line to describe the header of article, just like as below.</p><blockquote><p>-–<br>HEADER AREA<br>-–</p></blockquote><p>The header of the article will determine how the article will be displayed. Therefore fully filling the header of the article as much as possible will help to show it better.</p><ul><li>title: The title of article always show in everywhere.</li><li>subtitle: The subtitle is going to show below the title as abstract.</li><li>date: The contents of latest post side bar will be showed base on date.</li><li>categories: As classification of article, categories is used to fast search.
